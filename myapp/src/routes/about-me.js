          Dr. Chase founded Chase Bovine Services in August 2019 to bring his
          focus on improving dairy nutrition and production medicine to the New
          Zealand dairy industry. Chase Bovine Services provides dairy nutrition
          and veterinary consulting with specialties in on-farm management and
          protocol, reproduction programmes, trace mineral formulations, as well
          as nutrition advice.

          In 1999, Charlie graduated from the University of Florida with a
          doctorate in Veterinary Medicine and a Masterâ€™s degree in dairy
          nutrition. Upon graduation, he began work as a veterinarian in the San
          Joaquin Valley of California within a 100% dairy practice. While in
          practice, Charlie built a solid foundation in dairy medicine with
          attention toward sound reproductive performance, record analysis, and
          practical feeding strategies. Following eight years of dairy practice,
          Charlie took a role as dairy manager and herd veterinarian for a
          6000-cow dairy in California. During this time, Charlie was
          responsible for daily management decisions while working with 35
          employees to provide employee training, herd health programmes, and
          feeding programme management.

        <p className="item">
          Later, Dr. Chase moved into the role of technical services
          veterinarian with an international genetics company helping to train
          technicians in the proper techniques of heat detection, insemination,
          and reproductive programme management. Additional responsibilities
          included: client visits, seminars, and troubleshooting reproductive
          performance issues.
        </p>

        <p className="item">
          Prior to moving to New Zealand, Charlie worked as a veterinary dairy
          specialist with a prominent dairy nutrition company. In this role, he
          worked with nutritionists to balance rations for optimal performance
          and profitability and help with on-farm monitoring and
          troubleshooting.
        </p>

        <p className="item">
          The return to daily veterinary practice in the mid-Canterbury region
          allowed Charlie to gain a unique understanding of grazing-based dairy
          systems. During this time, he was instrumental in developing
          performance monitoring, analysis and planning programs within the
          veterinary practice. These programs allowed farmers to gain a greater
          understanding of their successes, as well as areas that provide
          opportunities for improvement.
        </p>

        <p className="item">
          Using the experience of working closely with grazing-based farms, Dr.
          Chase returned to corporate veterinary practice to share his
          experience and expertise internationally with customers across
          multiple different geographies before beginning service to the New
          Zealand dairy farmers as Chase Bovine Services.
